                <p>If you're interested in learning to sew your own clothes, contact Buffalo Modern Sewing for free sewing lessons!</p>
                <p>We'll work with you one-on-one to create a beginner-friendly project, such as a knit dress or an accessory (an infinity scarf or tote bag, for example). You can choose whatever you'd like to make, so as long as it isn't too complicated for your first try. </p>
                <p>We'll guide you through your project step-by-step and teach you tricks that we wish we had known when we started sewing.</p>
                <p>Because we hope that you'll love sewing as much as we do, we offer these lessons completely free of charge. </p>
                <h2>What You Will Bring</h2>
                <p>Please bring your own sewing machine to use, as each machine is different and learning on your own machine will make you more comfortable when it's time to sew at home. If you don't have a machine, you might consider borrowing a friend's or purchasing one used from Craigslist. Start off with a low-cost machine to find out if you enjoy sewing before you invest in a better model.</p>
                <p>You will also be responsible for buying your pattern and fabric. If you're making a dress, expect to pay about $25 for these items, as long as you buy on sale / with coupons. Patterns go on sale frequently at JoAnn Fabrics and fabric can be purchased using a coupon.</p>
                <p>If you would like help in choosing your fabric, we can meet you at the store to show you the fabrics and notions available and what we would recommend.</p>
                <h2>What We'll Provide</h2>
                <p>During your lessons, rulers, pins, scissors, and other notions will be available for your use.</p>
                <p>We will also provide you with a checklist that you can refer to for future projects, so that you don't miss a step when you're working on projects at home.</p>
                <h2>Where We'll Sew</h2>
                <p>The sewing location may vary, depending on space availability. We may meet at the Audubon Library in Amherst or at JoAnn Fabrics on Transit Road. Space is also available at one of our member's homes; we may meet there for second or third lessons.</p>
                <h2>When We'll Sew</h2>
                <p>We are generally available on weekends, so lessons will be scheduled on a Saturday or Sunday. If Saturday or Sunday does not work for you, we may be able to meet during the week in the evenings after 6 p.m.</p>
                <p>Lessons are usually 3 hours each. We will meet as many times as needed to complete your project.</p>
                <h2>How to Sign Up for Sewing Lessons</h2>
